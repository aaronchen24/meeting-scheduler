# Meeting-Scheduler

This application allows groups of people to coordinate the best mutual time to meet up. Each member registers an account and store his or her best times to meet up. The website collects all of the data from every member and displays the best times to meet using a gradient color scale. The darker the color, the more people that can meet at that time. Lastly, because a gradient color scheme prevents people with colorblindness from effectively using the application, the best times and dates will explicitly be stated.

# Possibly include best/available locations as well; link to Google Calendar?
